== Knative eventing

[.lead]
*Goal*: Provide a simple path to integrate "foreign" transport code (AMQP, MQTT, other...), with _little or no reference to knative APIs or concepts_, into a fully-featured knative importer. Separate concerns so that foreign and knative-specific code can be independently maintained by the right people for each task.
