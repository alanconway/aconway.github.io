*Goal*: Standard interface for Go-Based CloudEvents protocol bindings, for use
 In Knative eventing sources and similar applications: enable plug-and-play
 exchange protocol selection.

Package link:godoc/pkg/github.com/cloudevents/sdk-go/pkg/binding[binding] is an API for protocol bindings.

* See the link:github/pkg/cloudevents/sdk-go/issues/180[Pull Request] for code.
* There is an link:godoc/pkg/github.com/cloudevents/sdk-go/pkg/bindings/amqp[AMQP binding] example.


== Knative Eventing "Easy Sources"


*Goal*: Provide a simple path to integrate "foreign" protocol (AMQP, MQTT, other...), with _little or no knowledge of knative APIs or concepts_, into a fully-featured knative eventing source. Separate concerns so that foreign and knative-specific code can be independently maintained by the right people for each task.
